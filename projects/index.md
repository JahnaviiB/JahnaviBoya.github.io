[**MDP Planning & Cricket Game**](./aut22/mdp-and-cricket/)
- Developed MDP planner using Value Iteration, Howard's Policy Iteration and Linear Programming
- Utilised a pipeline of encoder, planner and decoder to predict outcome of a last-over cricket game

[**Multi-Armed Bandits**](./aut22/multi-armed-bandits/)
- Simulated regret minimization of multi-armed bandits using UCB, KL-UCB and Thompson Sampling
- Extended the implementation to batched sampling and restricted non-infinite horizon variates

## <a href="./spr22/" style="color: black">Spring 2022</a>

[**Peer-to-Peer Network Simulator**](./spr22/network-simulator/)
- Implemented socket programming in C++ to transfer files between clients using TCP connections
- Analyzed the network simulation in 5 phases using configuration files and a Bash script to automate

[**Image Segmentation via s-t Cuts**](./spr22/s-t-cut-seg/)
- Performed s-t cuts on a generated graph of superpixels to implement binary image segmentation
- Identified user scribbles to initialise Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm and achieved accuracy of 80%

[**Unblock Car Puzzle Solver**](./spr22/unblock-car/)
- Applied Python API of Z3 to encode moves and overlaps of unblock car puzzle into a SAT problem
- Solved the puzzle under the constraint of limited moves using conflict-driven clause learning

[**RISC Processor**](./spr22/risc-proc/)
- Devised an efficient finite-state automaton for a processor with predefined functionality using VHDL
- Tested architecture using testbench built in Quartus and a Python wrapper for assembly translation

## <a href="./aut21/" style="color: black">Autumn 2021</a>

[**Interface for GitHub Profiles**](./aut21/github-profiles/)
- Created an HTML webpage for user profiles secured with client-side HTTP Authentication tokens
- Implemented the backend using Django along with PostgreSQL database and GitHub REST API
- Deployed the project on Heroku Cloud Application Platform using GitLab CI/CD integration and CLI

[**Scotland Yard Game**](./aut21/scotland-yard/)
- Completed a Java implementation of 8 × 8 grid Scotland Yard using semaphores and concurrency
- Simulated client-server model with socket connections and upto 10 player threads listening on ports

[**SNAP Moodle**](./aut21/snap-moodle/)
- Designed a dynamic learning environment with a Django REST framework for the modular object-oriented backend consisting of models for Students, Teachers, Assignments and Courses
- Created an interactive user interface using HTML and React JavaScript library for the frontend

[**Data & Image Processing** ](./aut21/image-proc/)
- Used random samplings, statistical measures and Bayesian estimation to analyze several distributions
- Implemented Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for processing of high-dimensional images

[**Mandelbrot Zoom Simulation**](./aut21/mandelbrot-zoom/)
- Rendered Mandelbrot Zoom using Simple DirectMedia Layer library and Object-Oriented C++
- Used Binary Search Tree, Bipartite Graph, and Heap data structures for parts of the functionality

## <a href="./sum21/" style="color: black">Summer 2021</a>

[**Algorithmic Trading**](./sum21/algo-trading/)
- Designed trading strategies in Python and compared styles like momentum and paired switching
- Executed the algorithms on SENSEX 30 data of 2009-2020 and achieved profit upto 160% and 500%

[**Introduction to App Development**](./sum21/app-dev/)
- Utilised Flutter SDK (Google’s UI Toolkit) integrated with Android Studio and Dart programming language (developed by Google) as codebase to develop and debug applications on a virtual device
- Successfully built 3 Android applications (apk packages) from scratch including a 10-digit calculator, a true/false quiz app and a location-based weather app (by integrating an externally offered weather API

[**Snake Game**](./sum21/snake-game/)
- Implemented a graphics-based snake game using Object-Oriented Python and PyGame module

## <a href="./spr21/" style="color: black">Spring 2021</a>

[**Maze Game Builder**](./spr21/maze-game/)
- Utilised FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) widget library and C++ to create a graphic N × N maze game
- Handled an input array describing the obstacle locations to automate designing of maze layout

## <a href="./aut20/" style="color: black">Autumn 2020</a>

[**Lasso Game**](./aut20/lasso-game/)
- Visualized implementation of a single-player Lasso game in C++ using SimpleCPP Graphics package
- Enhanced the game by introducing 5 additional features using concepts of classes, inheritance & vectors
