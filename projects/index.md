## Spring 2022

[**Network Simulator**](./network-simulator/)
- Implemented socket programming in C++ to transfer files between clients using TCP connections
- Analyzed the network simulation in 5 phases using configuration files and a Bash script to automate

[**Image Segmentation via s-t Cuts**](./s-t-cut-seg/)
- Performed s-t cuts on a generated graph of superpixels to implement binary image segmentation
- Identified user scribbles to initialise Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm and achieved accuracy of 80%

[**Unblock Car Puzzle Solver**](./unblock-car/)
- Applied Python API of Z3 to encode moves and overlaps of unblock car puzzle into a SAT problem
- Solved the puzzle under the constraint of limited moves using conflict-driven clause learning

[**RISC Processor**](./risc-proc/)
- Devised an efficient finite-state automaton for a processor with predefined functionality using VHDL
- Tested architecture using testbench built in Quartus and a Python wrapper for assembly translation

## Autumn 2021

[**Interface for GitHub Profiles**](./github-profiles/)
- Created an HTML webpage for user profiles secured with client-side HTTP Authentication tokens
- Implemented the backend using Django along with PostgreSQL database and GitHub REST API
- Deployed the project on Heroku Cloud Application Platform using GitLab CI/CD integration and CLI

**Scotland Yard on a Grid** - [Course Project (Software Systems)](https://csedamp.wordpress.com/cs-251-software-systems-lab/)
- Completed a Java implementation of 8 × 8 grid Scotland Yard using semaphores and concurrency
- Simulated client-server model with socket connections and upto 10 player threads listening on ports

**SNAP Moodle** - [Course Project (Software Systems)](https://csedamp.wordpress.com/cs-251-software-systems-lab/)
- Designed a dynamic learning environment with a Django REST framework for the modular object-oriented backend onsisting of models for Students, Teachers, Assignments and Courses
- Created an interactive user interface using HTML and React JavaScript library for the frontend

**Data & Image Processing** - [Course Project (Data Analysis & Interpretation)](https://csedamp.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/cs-215-2019-20-review-1/)
- Used random samplings, statistical measures and Bayesian estimation to analyse several distributions
- Implemented Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for processing of high-dimensional images

**MAndelbrot Zoom** - [Course Project (Data Structures & Algorithms)](https://csedamp.wordpress.com/cs-293-data-structures-lab/)
- Rendered Mandelbrot Zoom using Simple DirectMedia Layer library and Object-Oriented C++
- Used Binary Search Tree, Bipartite Graph, and Heap data structures for parts of the functionality

## Summer 2021

**Algorithmic Trading** - [Learner's Space 2021, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/events/event/python)
- Designed trading strategies in Python and compared styles like momentum and paired switching
- Executed the algorithms on SENSEX 30 data of 2009-2020 and achieved profit upto 160% and 500%

**Introduction to App Development** - [Web & Coding Club, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/events/event/intro-app-dev)
- Utilised Flutter SDK (Google’s UI Toolkit) integrated with Android Studio and Dart programming language (developed by Google) as codebase to develop and debug applications on a virtual device
- Successfully built 3 Android applications (apk packages) from scratch including a 10-digit calculator, a true/false quiz app and a location-based weather app (by integrating an externally offered weather API

**Graphic Snake Game** - [Learner's Space 2021, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/events/event/python)
- Implemented a graphics-based snake game using Object-Oriented Python and PyGame module

## Spring 2021

**Maze Game Builder** - [Course Project (Abstractions & Paradigms for Programming)](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rkj/cs152.html)
- Utilised FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) widget library and C++ to create a graphic N × N maze game
- Handled an input array describing the obstacle locations to automate designing of maze layout

**The Lasso Game** - [Course Project (Computer Programming & Utilization)](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~cs101/)
- Visualized implementation of a single-player Lasso game in C++ using SimpleCPP Graphics package
- Enhanced the game by introducing 5 additional features using concepts of classes, inheritance & vectors
