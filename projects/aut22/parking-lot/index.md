## Description
This project in on application of concepts taught in class to
real world problems. In particular, we examine one of the most
popular domains: autonomous driving. We have a controller to
drive a car, and implement a destination chasing approach.

In Task 1, we have a controller that can navigate a car out of
a parking lot on a winter night. The surroundings are icy and
the parking lot is also close to freezing. It is our
responsibility to get the car out of this situation and on the
road safely.

Task 2 is along similar lines but we find ourselves in a
stickier situation. The parking lot is now filled with pools
of mud from a cold winter storm. We must dodge these obstacles
and find a safe way out.
