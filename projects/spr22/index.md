These are the projects I did during my fourth semester.

[**Peer-to-Peer Network Simulator**](./spr22/network-simulator/)
- Implemented socket programming in C++ to transfer files between clients using TCP connections
- Analyzed the network simulation in 5 phases using configuration files and a Bash script to automate

[**Image Segmentation via s-t Cuts**](./spr22/s-t-cut-seg/)
- Performed s-t cuts on a generated graph of superpixels to implement binary image segmentation
- Identified user scribbles to initialise Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm and achieved accuracy of 80%

[**Unblock Car Puzzle Solver**](./spr22/unblock-car/)
- Applied Python API of Z3 to encode moves and overlaps of unblock car puzzle into a SAT problem
- Solved the puzzle under the constraint of limited moves using conflict-driven clause learning

[**RISC Processor**](./spr22/risc-proc/)
- Devised an efficient finite-state automaton for a processor with predefined functionality using VHDL
- Tested architecture using testbench built in Quartus and a Python wrapper for assembly translation
