## Description
This project is based on building an automated attendance system using face recognition. We make use of multiple models chained together to achieve this. Our framework consists of a pre-trained deep neural network Caffe model for face detection within an image, deployed using OpenCV DNN configuration, followed by alignment using Haar Cascade Eye Detector. This is followed by use of Inception-ResNet v1 architecture combined with Triplet Loss. We conclude by checking classification using Softmax.
