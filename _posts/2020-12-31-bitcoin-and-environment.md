## Causes
![Causes](https://i.imgur.com/Wu0FAel.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Bitcoin was created in 2009. Since then, thousands of them have
entered the financial currency circulation. Cryptocurrency gained
popularity due to its virtuality. Bitcoin offers anonymity, freedom from
sales tax, and government interference. However, it adversely
impacts the economy and the environment. The special computers
which are involved in transactions require substantial amounts of
electricity. Almost all the impact is due to the mining equipment,
especially their geographical locations. Though the speeding up of
climatic change due to mining is because of the popularity of
cryptocurrency, it could also prove to be the biggest obstacle to its
growth.

## Effects
![Effects](https://i.imgur.com/kkI5BaN.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Bitcoin consumes 0.34% of the world's total electricity production,
accounting for 0.4% of the total consumption! This enormous amount
is sufficient to power all the tea kettles in the UK for 19 years! The
miners spend more time producing cryptocurrencies that are steadily
becoming scarce. As a result, the global consumption rate increases
further. The dependence on dirty resources like coal to produce
electricity using thermal power plants causes a significant increase in
carbon emissions. Due to this, Bitcoin is one of the reasons behind
global warming and environmental problems.

## Cryptocurrency Mining

The term "cryptocurrency mining" is one of the most controversial topics these
days. While many seem to work out a profit in cryptocurrency mining, it is not
that rewarding as calculations show that the investment made is over the revenue
earned. However, its volatility is more concerning than its energy consumption.
Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin are growing widely,
adding pressure to global energy consumption. The cryptocurrency
mining process is extremely energy-consuming. It is so extensive that
it can power the US household for a month. The carbon footprint due
to the Bitcoin miners worldwide is about 17 megatons on average,
every year and the numbers are to increase in the upcoming years.
Cryptocurrency mining can raise the temperature of Earth by over 2
degrees Celsius in about thirty years. The number of miners for
cryptocurrencies has risen exponentially over the past few years.
With better technological advancements in miners, the consumption
of electricity has augmented. The miners used for cryptocurrencies
are highly occupation-specific and add additional pressure on energy
consumption. The latest miners require twice as much electricity due
to their sophistication. Moreover, the biohazard miners add a threat to
the environment since most of their parts are non-biodegradable.

## Statistics of Cryptocurrency Mining
![Statistics](https://i.imgur.com/W7EnzCY.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Large strains on the energy sector with continuously running
machines, as the computers in transactions require an extensive
power supply. A typical server costs about 6,200 US dollars,
consuming approximately 1.5 kilowatts of energy to mine a single
Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network consumed more than 2.55 gigawatts of
electricity in 2018. The equivalent net power consumption of Bitcoin
had the potential to swell up to 7.67 gigawatts. This much is enough
to run a small country! The energy usage levels of Bitcoin mining
farms superseded those of entire nations such as Ireland (3.1
gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts) after 2018. Due to
geographical reasons, countries like China account for approximately
85% of the world's trading transactions and host crypto-mines that
contribute 74% to the Bitcoin mining hash rates.

## Implications for Future

To mitigate the impact of crypto-mining activities on the energy
sector, local and federal governments need to create a regulatory
environment that manages the impact-including federal support and
local efforts to grapple with this global phenomenon. The
unbalanced energy consumptions that mining operations impose on
communities require strict energy regulations to sustain mining
businesses while simultaneously protecting the local community’s
access to affordable energy. Policymakers should consider ways to
curb rogue operators while maintaining a balance between public
safety and economic development.
