## Description
The Game:

The city is an 8 x 8 grid, a Fugitive runs amok. In a single
turn, the Fugitive can move like a chess Queen: horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. Upto k (say, 5, but that's easily
winning for a smart Fugitive. You can tweak this) Detectives
attempt to catch the Fugitive. Detectives move like chess
Rooks: horizontally, or vertically. In this game, Players
don't block each others' paths.

The Detectives win if one of them lands on the same square as
the Fugitive, or if the Fugitive quits the game.

The Detectives lose if none of them can catch the Fugitive
within N (say, 25; again, you can tweak this) timesteps.

The Fugitive can see everyone, but is mostly invisible to the
Detectives: the Fugitive only surfaces when 3 mod 5 timesteps
have passed, i.e. at timesteps, 3, 8, â€¦ , 23, and finally 25,
when the game is over.
