## Description
IITB-RISC is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the
teaching that is based on the Little Computer Architecture.
The IITB-RISC is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system. It has
8 general-purpose registers (R0 to R7). Register R7 is always
stores Program Counter. All addresses are short word addresses
(i.e., address 0 corresponds to the first two bytes of main
memory, address 1 corresponds to the second two bytes of main
memory, etc.). This architecture uses condition code register
which has two flags Carry flag (C) and Zero flag (Z). The
IITB-RISC is very simple, but it is general enough to solve
complex problems. The architecture allows predicated instruction
execution and multiple load and store execution. There are
three machine-code instruction formats (R, I, and J type) and
a total of 17 instructions.
