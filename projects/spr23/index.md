These are the projects I did during my sixth semester.

[**Speech Recognition**](./speech-recog/)
- Trained LLMs including M5, M11 and LSTM-based RNN using MFCC features on Speech Commands dataset

[**Layer 2 Dapp**](./l2-dapp/)
- Developed a layer 2 decentralized application in Solidity on top of Blockchain
- Created a joint-accounts transfer network and simulated balances across nodes

[**P2P Crypto Network with Attacks**](./p2p-crypto-attacks/)
- Extended the Cryptocurrency network simulator by adding malicious miners along with honest
- Implemented selfish and stubborn modes of adversarial behaviour and analyzed block trees

[**P2P Crypto Network**](./p2p-crypto/)
- Build a P2P Cryptocurrency simulator using peers, transactions and blocks along with
probabilistic parameters
- Simulated transactions in the network by modeling latencies and handling proof-of-work

[**Audio-Visual Instance Discrimination**](./avid/)
- Evaluated the AVID-CMA model using HMDB-51 dataset and modified evaluation parameters

[**Limestone Data Challenge**](./ldc-2023/)
- Analyzed stock indices data in a toy dataset using clustering and predicted the composition
of indices

[**Inter-IIT Tech: Route Planning Optimisation**](./inter-iit/)
- Worked on Reinforcement Learning based approach to solve the vehicle routing problem

[**IITB CSE Research Symposium Website**](./symposium/)
