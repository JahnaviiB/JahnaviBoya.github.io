## Description
This project was based on implementation of [this](https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i8/H7423068819.pdf) paper.
The abstract is as below:
Image Segmentation has always been a problem of interest and
the challenging task in the field of the computer-based vision
system. It plays a vital role in the field of object detection
and recognition. Identifying with separating a part of the
interest from a complicated image is easy for the human vision
system, but the same is cumbersome to automate. The proposed
work is a novel combined technology for fast segmentation of
foreground (area of interest) out of an image which possesses
a background and other complications. This work utilizes the
latest industrial class technologies with advanced algorithms.
Our approach remarkably increased the performance by working
on a super-pixelated image rather than a normal n x n pixel
image. The proposed work is mainly focused on interactive
segmentation. This could be actively used in fields like the
medical analysis. Our segmentation technique is a binary
segmentation where it classifies pixels into two distinct sets.
The proposed scheme is experimentally shown to compare
favorably with contemporary interactive image segmentation
schemes when applied to colored and gray-scale images.
